# Bagnon
This is the normal Bagnon addon but with a button to open the bank window(up arrow in topleft), and a button to delete profiles(for deleted characters)(x button next to profile name).  

I also consolidated Bagnon into a single addon(instead of five different addons). So if you already have Bagnon installed, you need to delete those folders.  

PS: In pic-related, there is also the Clean_Up button in the topright.
