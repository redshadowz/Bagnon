# Bagnon
This is the normal Bagnon addon but with a button to open the bank window, and button to delete profiles(for deleted characters).  
I also consolidated Bagnon into a single addon(instead of five different addons). So if you already have Bagnon installed, you need to delete those folders.  
PS: This addon uses my preferred default settings(which can be changed by right-clicking on the window title).
